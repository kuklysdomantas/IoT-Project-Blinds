## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic understanding of Internet of Things (IoT) concepts by implementing a simple blinds control system. This project aims to showcase how DIY IoT project can be applied in home automation.

## Features
- Control: Users can control the blinds via a mobile app or web interface.
- Real-time Monitoring: The current state of the blinds (open/closed) is displayed on the user interface.
- Remote Access: Users can control the blinds remotely, offering flexibility in operation.
  
## Components Used
- Microcontroller: ESP-12E NodeMcu with ESP8266
- Motor/Actuator: Stepper motor with ULN2003 controller module
- Wi-Fi Module: Built-in on the microcontroller for wireless communication
- Mobile/Web App: Blynk platform
- Power Supply: 5V power supply to run the system
- Breadboard
- Wires
- Power supply socket
